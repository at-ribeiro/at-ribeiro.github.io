# **Project Details**

- **✅ State:** Concluded  
- **⏳ Duration:** 1 year 
- **👥 Team Size:** 1 member + 2 advisors
- **💼 My Roles:**

  - Designer
  - Researcher
- **🛠️ Languages, Engines and Tools Used:** 
    - Unity 
    - C#  
- **💡 Key Contributions:**  
  - Developed and studied four VR Portal designs that permit the navigation of expansive Virtual Environments by naturally walking in small physical spaces. 
  - The results of the study show that the developed portal variants addressed common VR portals' limitations successfully, which resulted in the submission of a paper for the ICAT-EGVE conference. 
  - Conducted a preliminary user study comparing teleportation and portal-based locomotion, leading to a publication at ACM Multimedia.
