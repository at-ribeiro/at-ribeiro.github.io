## About my work

My experience spans across multiple fields, mostly related with **Game Development**, **Multimedia** and **Computer Science** in general. However, I also have an enriching artistic background during my middle/high school years. I was fortunate to have professors that instigated me to follow my aspirations and incentivized me to participate in **Creative Writing** contests, as well as a **Public Speaking** workshop and **Theatre**. I intend to join these two branches of my knowledge together throughout my career. 

Given I have a heavier Computer Science background, my strongest skills are related with programming, yet I don't shy away from other aspects of game-development. If I had to describe myself I would say:

> I'm a Gameplay and Tool Programmer with decent knowledge on the rest of the field.

Through the content on this website, you'll be able to understand how all my skills come into play when I develop a game. Hopefully, you'll also be able to understand where all my passion and inspiration for this medium comes from, when I dissect and study my favorite works (whether they're games, films or music), which I also hope might be educational and inspirational to you as well.

I'm usually open for collaborations and discussion, so if you'd like to talk about something that interests you, you can reach me through e-mail or any of my social platforms.

## About this website

One of the most common advices I get from professionals in the Game Development industry is to **build a portfolio** and **make yourself known**. This website serves those purposes by:

- **Building a Portfolio** - You can learn all about my games and the details about their development by accessing the Portfolio tab. Additionally, you might find some of the posts that delve deeper into several game-dev topics by exploring certain components of my games.

- **Making myself known** - The posts on this website serve as a central hub for all the content I publish across diverse social media platforms. They showcase my journey, development insights, and deep dives into game mechanics and design. Whether you're interested in game development perspectives, technical breakdowns, or simply want to see what skills I bring to this industry, you'll find it all here.

I have also been advised to stand out as a unique and memorable presence in the game development community, and I believe this is the best way to do so while staying true to myself.

## About me

I've been in love with Computers, Games, and Entertainment for as long as I can remember. From endlessly rewatching ***Pixar's*** finest films to my first gaming adventures on the legendary ***PlayStation 2*** — which I still own and play to this day — my passion for storytelling and adventure in virtual worlds began at my earliest years on this planet and has only grown stronger throughout my life. It was not long until I started exploring my home computer, not only to play more games, but to also explore the internet, watch videos about my current obsession, or popping in on ***Newgrounds*** every once in a while to play some fan games, like the nostalgic [Final Fantasy Sonic X](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/443187), or watch fan animations, such as the iconic [Super Mario Bros Z](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/308690).

Given this, I was one of the fortunate kids who pretty much knew what they wanted to do for a living once they grew up: **I wanted to create and tell stories**. With the passing of the years, the medium I wished to tell these stories changed from time to time, but video-games were the most constant favorite, and remained so until today, as I believe they are **the ultimate way to experience an interactive story**.

I'm now accomplishing this goal by finishing my Master's Degree in Computer Science, with a thesis in Non-Euclidean Virtual Reality, while making games and the content present in this website on the side, to enrich my portfolio and experience.
