## Who am I?

I've been in love with Computers, Games, and Entertainment for as long as I can remember. From endlessly rewatching ***Pixar's*** finest films to my first gaming adventures on the legendary ***PlayStation 2***—which I still own and play to this day—my passion for storytelling and adventure in virtual worlds began in my earliest years on this planet and has only grown stronger throughout my life. It was not long until I started exploring my home computer, not only to play more games, but to also explore the internet, watch videos about my current obsession, or popping in on ***Newgrounds*** every once in a while to play some fan games, like the nostalgic [Final Fantasy Sonic X](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/443187), or watch fan animations, such as the iconic [Super Mario Bros Z](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/308690).
